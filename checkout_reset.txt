This file is for testing git functions as follows: git checkout -- file && git reset HEAD file

After I use the command git checkout -- file, I found the error which means -- is unnecessary as I though. When I removed it, It worked.

---

This time I will use the command git reset HEAd file, to return to the latest "git add" state.

The result showed that the command git reset HEAD file is to use before git commit && after git add.

After I use the command git reset HEAD file, the state will be back to modified && not add, what's more, if you insist losing them, use the command git checkout file.
